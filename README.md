*** Weather-Dashboard ***

## Description

Weather-Dashboard Application is aimed at finding the weather condition of a given city or cities both the current and also give a 5-Days forecast.
The server-side API used to get response data object is retrieved from the Open Weather APi.
The current weather section of the dashboard includes the following weather features and current date.
- City, Date, Icon-image
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- UV index

The 5-days weather forecast feature displayed below the current weather conditions section includes the following information for each day:
- Date
- Icon image
- Temperature
- Humidity
The local storage is used here to store previously searched city or cities and then display them to the user in the left side of the page under the list group. A useful feature I added for the user is a 'Clear Holder' button which the user can use to clear the previously searched city or cities by clicking.
If the user wants to see the perviously searched city's or cities' weather condition again, all the user has to do is just click on the city of interest from the list group item cities under the clear holder button.
